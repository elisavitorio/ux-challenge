# UX-challenge - The development

The first stage of the development of RD Station Case Study page was the analysis of the content and the elements that should be included on the page, identifying the main elements and which should be emphasized for the user. Then, a fast benchmark was made, and the wireframes were designed. Some layout options for the content were made, seeking to show the content in the most clear and organized way for the user. For that, the case studies menu is on the left sidebar to emphasize this menu from the others RD Station menus. In the right sidebar are the additional information, helping to distribute content on the page and emphasizing the important elements, such as boxes of results and customer testimonials. After this, the Bootstrap components were analyzed to define which could be used and which would have to be custom. So, the visual refinement of the page was made, choosing fonts, colors and visual effects. For the page style, it was decided to use a clean look without many variations of colors and elements, with emphasis on the text area, guiding the user reading. After that, the development of HTML + CSS was started. The RD Station page was used as a base by inserting the components of the Bootstrap and customize the necessary elements. With HTML + CSS ready, were tests done on some browsers and then was made the deploy on Github.
